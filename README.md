# Compiler in JavaScript using ANTLR

[BerlinJS meetup](https://berlinjs.org), 16.08.2018

There are plenty of options, if you need to translate one language to another (for example English to German). But what about programming languages? Is it possible to translate JavaScript to Python? Is there any way to customise this process? Where to start?

This talk was about language compilers and basic principles behind it. It sounds a bit scientific, but it is a very interesting topic that is probably significantly different from the routine programming tasks.

The talk was based on my blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/dailyjs/compiler-in-javascript-using-antlr-9ec53fd2780f).
