## Abstract

There are plenty of options, if you need to translate one language to another (for example English to German). But what about programming languages? Is it possible to translate JavaScript to Python? Is there any way to customise this process? Where should you start?

Lets talk about language compilers and basic principles behind it. It sounds a bit scientific, but it can also be very interesting and probably significantly different from your routine programming tasks.
